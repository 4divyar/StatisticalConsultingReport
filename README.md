# Premier League Predictability: A Statistical Consulting Report
**How well does the Premier League table after Boxing Day matches predict the end-of-season table?**

This report contains a comprehensive nonparametric statistical analysis examining the predictive relationship between Premier League teams' mid-season performance (Boxing Day standings) and their final season outcomes. The project addresses two key research questions: whether there is a strong positive association between Boxing Day points and final point totals, and whether Boxing Day standings accurately predict final league placement.
